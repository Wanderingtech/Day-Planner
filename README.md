# Day-Planner
Wk 5 HW. A daily planner/scheduler
## Goals
* To create a daily planner based off average work day

* Have timeblocks for input of tasks

* Color code the tasks for past/present/future

* Have the event save to local storage

* Prevent the data from being cleared on refresh

## Improvements
This is completely unfinished. I struggled with whether it was preferred to create the elements through JQuery or to edit the HTML. Also, I found it difficult to know what kind of element I was creating based off reading the CSS and HTML given. I could understand the class vs ID but then when it came to input or other type, I felt lost.

Will continue to work through this and resubmit a finished project.
