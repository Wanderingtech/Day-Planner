# Day-Planner
Wk 5 HW. A daily planner/scheduler
## Goals
* To create a daily planner based off average work day

* Have timeblocks for input of tasks

* Color code the tasks for past/present/future

* Have the event save to local storage

* Prevent the data from being cleared on refresh

## Improvements
The planner functions with the color changes and the input saves to local storage. Struggling with displaying the local storage back on the planner after page refresh.

Will continue to work through this and resubmit a finished project.
